Project: SpendSavvy - Personal Budget Tracker 💰
Hey there! 👋 I built SpendSavvy as part of my educational journey, and I’m super excited about it! It’s a simple yet powerful Python tool to help anyone track their income and expenses like a pro. Whether you’re saving for a dream vacation 🌴 or just want to keep an eye on your daily coffee spending ☕, this project has got you covered!

What’s It About? 🤔
SpendSavvy is a command-line app that lets you:
- Add your income (yay, money coming in! 💸)
- Log your expenses (oops, money going out! 🛒)
- View your income and expense details with totals
- Feel in control of your budget!

Features That Shine ✨
- Add Income: Enter a description (like “Freelance Gig”) and amount—saved instantly!
- Add Expenses: Track what you spend (e.g., “Pizza Night 🍕”) with ease.
- Show Details: See all your income or expenses in a neat list, plus the total.
- Cool ASCII Art: Fancy banners for “Income” and “Expense” using pyfiglet—because why not? 😎
- Data Persistence: Everything is stored in JSON files (income.json and expenses.json) so your data sticks around.
- 
Tech & Tricks I Used 🛠️
- Python: The backbone of the project—simple and fun to code with!
- JSON: For saving and loading data (no database needed—just files!).
- Pyfiglet: Adds those eye-catching text banners to make the app look stylish.
- Error Handling: Try-except blocks to catch pesky input mistakes (no crashes here!).
- File Management: Uses os.path.exists() to check if files exist before reading/writing—pretty smart, right?
